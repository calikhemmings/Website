The goodbyes said to your 3rd grade friends after a fun day in the park. The goodbyes said to your late family members and friends. The goodbyes said to everyone when it’s simply your time to go. We can dance around the subject, passionately discuss climate change and pastel colors, but the reality of the situation is that I am saying now it is my time to say goodbye to you.  \r\n\r\nI don’t know where to start. Hard to believe it has actually been 3 years. You and I have been fighting frequently, so frequent that I struggle to appreciate what you have done to me. You changed me. When we first met I was ready to fall in love. My previous relationship was coming to an end and it was time to find someone new. Someone that could challenge me, make me better, and prepare me for the rest of my life. \r\n\r\nThank you, Mom. For believing in me when I didn’t have enough energy to do the same. For loving me unconditionally when I didn’t deserve it. For showing me that we are all flawed in some way, shape, or form.\r\n\r\nThank you, Steven. For being the best friend a person can have. For showing me For allowing me to lose myself\r\n\r\n",
